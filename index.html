				<h2>Discovery &amp; Voting</h2>
				<p>Mostly Harmless looks up the page you are currently viewing to see if it has been submitted to reddit. If so, you can see everywhere it has been posted, vote the story up or down, and even save, hide, and report the post straight from the popup.</p>

				<h2>Commenting</h2>
				<p>Comments and discussion are a huge part of reddit, so it was important to bake that capability right into Mostly Harmless. You can add a comment from the popup, and if you&rsquo;re typing a particularly long comment and accidentally close the popup, Mostly Harmless should still have it cached!</p>

				<h2>Desktop Notifications</h2>
				<p>Every redditor knows the joy of getting an orangered. Every redditor <em>also</em> knows that finding out what it&rsquo;s for, who it&rsquo;s from, and what it says is half of the fun! Mostly Harmless will check for orangereds at a specified interval and display a desktop notification when you get one. Of course, you can turn this off if you like.</p>

				<h2>Privacy</h2>
				<p>Your browsing habits are your own, and you probably don&rsquo;t want every page you visit checked on reddit. Instead, Mostly Harmless has an option to only look up pages when you click its icon. Of course that could get tedious, so Mostly Harmless also supports excluding lookups based on domain and regular expression matches.</p>

				<h2>Why does it take so long to get an orangered notification?</h2>
				<p>I was told by the reddit admins on <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=reddit-dev">#reddit-dev</a> to make the minimum interval for checking orangereds five minutes. If you think Mostly Harmless should be able to poll <code>http://www.reddit.com/api/me.json</code> more often, please <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=chromakode">send a PM to chromakode</a>, and then <a href="http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=spladug">send one to spladug</a>.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<pre><code data-language="irc">&lt;chromakode&gt; KerrickLong, can you please reduce the mail interval at minimum every 5 minutes?
&lt;KerrickLong&gt; Five minutes? Yeah I can.
&lt;chromakode&gt; also, can you please add app=mh as an extra param to your api requests? that way we can tell you some interesting stats about its utilization!
&lt;KerrickLong&gt; chromakode, if I make the orangereds poll /api/me.json instead of /messages/new, could I reduce the interval since it will be a LOT less load?
&lt;spladug&gt; KerrickLong, /api/me.json would be preferable, but 5 minutes would still be nice. we've seen some crazy high load from shine the last few days and would like to try to avoid having the same issue again</code></pre>

				<h2>Why aren&rsquo;t you using Snoo, the reddit alien, as the icon?</h2>
				<p>The reddit alien logo is a trademark of Conde Nast Digital, and I am required to <a href="http://www.reddit.com/help/licensing">apply for a license to use it</a>. I have done so, and am waiting to hear back. Until then, I cannot use Snoo.</p>
				<h2>What do the default &ldquo;Excluded Regex&rdquo; patterns mean?</h2>
