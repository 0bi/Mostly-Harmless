This is an upcoming reddit extension for Google Chrome.

1. It looks and functions just like reddit, but is API driven (I'm not just iframing reddit or anything).

2. It is going to support everything reddit does, including share, report, and hide.

3. Its submit dialog will bring up a submission box in the popup, and it will support subreddit suggestions as you type, and have a brand new function... Forced reposts! If something has already been posted to a subreddit you are trying to submit it to, the extension will append a URL query string to it so it still goes through.

4. Once infobars come out of the expiremental API, I'll be implementing a UI similar to Socialite as well.

5. I hope to open source this and get it officially endorsed by reddit in the same way Socialite and RedditAddict are.
